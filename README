Installation
======================
# Install rails
gem install rails --pre

# Start redis
./redis-server

# Start the server
rails server


Current Mission:
======================
- prepare some suitable test data
    - set of countries
    - set of music artists (minimal techno genre)
    - set of movies (facets: director, filming location, budget, etc.)
    
- define a uniform json collection format

- Collection#load should load a collection by accessing the service located at Collection#uri.
  The parsed json data is then parsed and serialized to ruby objects and persisted in redis.
  

Requirements:
======================
Envision is developed and tested against Ruby (1.9.1) and Rails (3.0.0-beta3)
